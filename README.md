# Tech-Haven

Tech Haven isn't just a run-of-the-mill tech store. It's a treasure trove of peripherals, gadgets, and all things tech, brought to you by trusted vendors from all over the world. Every $10 or more purchase earns you points that can be redeemed for amazing tech gear and early access to only the hottest new products. 

 
## Design Process
 

- As a customer of the website, I want to see the price and the rating of the items i want to buy from the checkout area so that i do not make a mistake when buying an item
- As a customer of the website, I want to see how the product looks like through images so that I can make calculated decisions when buying an item
- As a seller of the website, I want the website to be seamless and user-friendly with its navigation and its features so that there will be more potential customers to help grow my business
- As a vendor I would like to provide customers with a 3d model so that they can get a better idea of what my products would look like and be more inclined to purchase them
