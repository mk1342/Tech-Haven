# Tech-Haven

Tech Haven isn't just a run-of-the-mill tech store. It's a treasure trove of peripherals, gadgets, and all things tech, brought to you by trusted vendors from all over the world. Every $10 or more purchase earns you points that can be redeemed for amazing tech gear and early access to only the hottest new products. 

 
## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a customer of the website, I want to see the price and the rating of the items i want to buy from the checkout area so that i do not make a mistake when buying an item
- As a customer of the website, I want to see how the product looks like through images so that I can make calculated decisions when buying an item
- As a seller of the website, I want the website to be seamless and user-friendly with its navigation and its features so that there will be more potential customers to help grow my business
- As a vendor I would like to provide customers with a 3d model so that they can get a better idea of what my products would look like and be more inclined to purchase them

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
